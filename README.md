Drone Detector

Python code that handles data from HackRF One. The code will solve three tasks

1. Spectrum analyzer and waterfall plotting. Maximum holding of last x seconds.
2. The Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) Algorithm automatically detects distinct activity frequencies and compares them to a frequency table.
3. Machine Learning algorithm which will check the distinct activity frequencies and use machine learning to more accurately classify the signal
